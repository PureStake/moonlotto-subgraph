# MoonLotto Subgraph

An example subgraph initially forked from The Graph [example subgraph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph). Created by Purestake to get you started with The Graph on Moonbeam.

## Deploying contracts

For deploying contracts on Moonbase Alpha, you'll need a funded account and its private key. Store it in a ENV variable like this:

```shell
export MOON_PRIVATE_KEY="99b3c12287537e38c90a9219d4cb074a89a16e9cdb20bf85728ebd97c343e342"  
```

> Or the Moonbeam docs on https://docs.moonbeam.network/.
